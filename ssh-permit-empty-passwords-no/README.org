User accounts should have passwords. Without passwords accounts are not secure.

If possible it is recommended to inhibit the use of passwords at all and instead realy on keys with

=PasswordAuthentication no=

but inhibiting login with empty passwords is an excellent fallback and good to have present in case a situation prevents the use of keys.

* Examples

Add =PermitEmptyPasswords yes= to =/etc/ssh/sshd_config=.

#+begin_example
$ grep ^PermitEmpty /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitEmptyPasswords yes
$ sudo cf-agent -KIb ssh_permit_empty_passwords_no
    info: Using command line specified bundlesequence
    info: Copied file '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' to '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged.cfnew' (mode '600')
    info: Removed old backup '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged.cfsaved'
    info: Backed up '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged' as '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged.cfsaved'
    info: Moved '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged.cfnew' to '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged'

    info: Replaced pattern '^\s*(PermitEmptyPasswords\s+(?!no$).*|PermitEmptyPasswords)$' in '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged'
    info: replace_patterns promise '^\s*(PermitEmptyPasswords\s+(?!no$).*|PermitEmptyPasswords)$' repaired
    info: Edited file '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged'
    info: Copied file '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged' to '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.cfnew' (mode '640')
    info: Removed old backup '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.cfsaved'
    info: Backed up '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' as '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.cfsaved'
    info: Moved '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.cfnew' to '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'
    info: Updated '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' from source '/etc/ssh/sshd_config.staged' on 'localhost'
    info: Executing 'no timeout' ... '/bin/systemctl --no-ask-password --global --system -q restart sshd'
    info: Completed execution of '/bin/systemctl --no-ask-password --global --system -q restart sshd'
$ grep ^PermitEmpty /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitEmptyPasswords no
#+end_example

The reason that there is quite a bit of output is because it's a multi-step process:

- Backup the config
- Edit the config
- Replace old config with new config
- Restart SSH daemon

If you run =cf-agent -KI= again, there will be no output, no changes will be made, since the configuration is already correct.

* How it works

This module ensures that =PermitEmptyPasswords= is set to =no= in =/etc/ssh/sshd_config= leveraging =lib_sshd_config:global_key_values= from the [[https://build.cfengine.com/modules/inventory-local-users][library-sshd-config]] module.
